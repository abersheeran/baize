Powerful and exquisite WSGI/ASGI framework/toolkit. Use [MyPyC](https://mypyc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to improve code running speed.

The minimize implementation of methods required in the Web framework. No redundant implementation means that you can freely customize functions without considering the conflict with baize's own implementation.

Under the ASGI/WSGI protocol, the interface of the request object and the response object is almost the same, only need to add or delete `await` in the appropriate place. In addition, it should be noted that ASGI supports WebSocket but WSGI does not.

- Type annotations as strict as possible (almost no Any)
- Support range file response, server-sent event response
- Support WebSocket (only ASGI)
- WSGI, ASGI routing to combine any application like [Django(wsgi)](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/howto/deployment/wsgi/)/[Pyramid](https://trypyramid.com/)/[Bottle](https://bottlepy.org/)/[Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) or [Django(asgi)](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/howto/deployment/asgi/)/[Index.py](https://index-py.aber.sh/)/[Starlette](https://www.starlette.io/)/[FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)/[Sanic](https://sanic.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)/[Quart](https://pgjones.gitlab.io/quart/)

## Quick Start

A short example for WSGI application, if you don't know what is WSGI, please read [PEP3333](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3333/).

```python
from baize.wsgi import request_response, Router, Request, Response, PlainTextResponse


@request_response
def sayhi(request: Request) -> Response:
    return PlainTextResponse("hi, " + request.path_params["name"])


@request_response
def echo(request: Request) -> Response:
    return PlainTextResponse(request.body)


application = Router(
    ("/", PlainTextResponse("homepage")),
    ("/echo", echo),
    ("/sayhi/{name}", sayhi),
)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    import uvicorn

    uvicorn.run(application, interface="wsgi", port=8000)
```

A short example for ASGI application, if you don't know what is ASGI, please read [ASGI Documention](https://asgi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

```python
from baize.asgi import request_response, Router, Request, Response, PlainTextResponse


@request_response
async def sayhi(request: Request) -> Response:
    return PlainTextResponse("hi, " + request.path_params["name"])


@request_response
async def echo(request: Request) -> Response:
    return PlainTextResponse(await request.body)


application = Router(
    ("/", PlainTextResponse("homepage")),
    ("/echo", echo),
    ("/sayhi/{name}", sayhi),
)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    import uvicorn

    uvicorn.run(application, interface="asgi3", port=8000)
```
